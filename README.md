# tradingview_adduser_api
Python selenium API to automate user access to your Trading View invite-only indicator.

1. This is a simple project that starts a Flask server containing only one endpoint.
2. The endpoint uses Selenium webdriver to login to your trading view account and add a user to any of your invite-only indicators.
3. Set your own TradingView password AND keep it safe.
