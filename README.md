# tradingview_adduser_api
Python selenium API to automate user access to your Trading View invite-only indicator.

1. This is a simple project that starts a Flask server containing only one endpoint.
2. The endpoint uses Selenium webdriver to automatically login to your trading view account and add a user to any of your invite-only indicators.
3. Set your own TradingView user and password AND keep it safe!

Things to improve:

- Add the expiration date of the access.
- Add a delete user operation.
- Move the password to a SECURE properties file.
